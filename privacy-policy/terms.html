                      <br />
                        <p>Welcome to myeNovation (“myeNovation,” “we,” “us,” “our”) and thank you for using our products and services (“Services”). The following myeNovation Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”) govern the use of the Services for paying and non-paying myeNovation customers, except for enterprise customers who have entered into a written myeNovation Software as a Service Enterprise Agreement with us (“Enterprise Agreement”). If you are an myeNovation enterprise customer who has entered into an Enterprise Agreement, your use is governed by the Enterprise Agreement executed by you and myeNovation; if no such Enterprise Agreement is in place, your use is governed by these Terms in existence at the beginning of your then-current subscription period.


                             

                     <br/> <br/>
                     <strong>      
                            1. GENERAL INFORMATION  </strong> <br/>
                            The Services are offered subject to your acceptance of these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and any additional terms and policies (including operating rules, guidelines and procedures) that may apply depending on your particular use of the Services. ​ By using the Services or by clicking on an acceptance box for these Terms, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and all other applicable terms and policies. If you do not agree with these Terms and policies, do not use or access the Services or click on the acceptance box. If you will be using the Services on behalf of a company or any other entity, you agree to these Terms on behalf of that entity and you represent that you have the authority to do so. In such case, “you” and “your” will refer to that entity. Additionally, since the Services are available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old and take full responsibility for the selection and use of the Services. These Terms are void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Services is revoked in such jurisdictions.
                            
                            <br/> <br/>
                            <strong>       2. REGISTRATION  </strong> <br/>
                            In order to use certain features of the Services, you may be required to register for a Services subscription. You warrant that any registration information (such as name, contact information, or other information) you submit to myeNovation is accurate, complete, and not misleading, and you agree to keep such information up to date. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of these Terms and may result in immediate termination of your account. To the extent you are able to select a “user name” you may not (i) select or use a name or identifier that is a name of another person or entity with the intent to impersonate that person or entity; (ii) select or use a name or identifier that creates confusion in end user and others as to your own identity; (iii) use a name or identifier that is subject to any rights of a person or entity other than you without appropriate authorization; or (iv) use a name or identifier that is offensive, vulgar, obscene, or unlawful. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to cancel or refuse registration of any name or identifier we believe violates these Terms, our policies, or the law. You shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and other account information. Your login must only be used by one person; a single login shared by multiple people is not permitted. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your myeNovation usernames and passwords. myeNovation is not liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this Section 2. We may use your registration information and any technical information about your use of the Services to tailor its presentations to you, facilitate your movement through the Services, communicate separately with you or publish the fact that you are a user of our services.
                            
                            <br/> <br/>
                            <strong>       3. YOUR CONTENT  </strong> <br/>
                            As between you and myeNovation, you retain ownership of the intellectual property rights of the content you submit to us or the Services (“Your Content”), except for the limited rights that enable us to perform the Services. In short, what’s yours is yours, but we do need certain permissions from you so that our processing, maintenance, storage, technical reproduction, back-up, distribution, and related handling of Your Content does not infringe applicable copyright and other laws. Therefore, in order to perform the Services, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, and irrevocable (for so long as Your Content is stored with us) license to use, reproduce, and display Your Content as reasonably necessary to provide you with the Services. You are responsible for maintaining, protecting, and making backups of Your Content. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we will not be liable for the loss or corruption of Your Content.
                            
                            <br/> <br/>
                            <strong>       4. OUR CONTENT  </strong> <br/>
                            Using the Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in the Services. You agree that all myeNovation content and materials delivered via the Services or otherwise made available by myeNovation (collectively, “Our Content”) are protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, or other proprietary rights and laws. Except as expressly authorized by myeNovation in writing, you agree not to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit, or create derivative works of Our Content. Reproducing, copying, or distributing any of Our Content or myeNovation design elements for any other purpose is strictly prohibited without our express prior written permission. Use of Our Content for any purpose not expressly permitted in these Terms is prohibited. myeNovation reserves any rights not expressly granted in these Terms.

                            <strong>       5. USE OF THE SERVICES  </strong> <br/>
                            You represent and warrant that (i) your use of the Services will comply with all laws and regulations; (ii) Your Content will not infringe or violate any third-party intellectual property rights or any laws or regulations (including, without limitation, obscenity, defamation, and privacy laws); (iii) if you use the Services on behalf of any third party, you have all necessary authorizations; and (iv) your use of the Services will not conflict with any obligations you have to any third party. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to remove, modify, prevent access to, or refuse to display Your Content that we believe violates these Terms, our policies, or the law.
                            
                            <br/> <br/>
                            <strong>       6. ACCOUNTS AND FEES  </strong> <br/>
                            myeNovation offers a Free subscription that you may use to try out our services. At any time, you may upgrade to any of myeNovation’s paid subscriptions. If you are a paying user of the Services, you shall pay myeNovation Service fees in accordance with this Section 6 and our pricing policy located at www.myeNovation.com/pricing (“Fees”). You will be billed for your first subscription term immediately upon upgrading to a paid subscription. Subscriptions will automatically renew for a period equal in length to the preceding subscription period. All Fees will be invoiced in advance (on a monthly or annual basis depending upon the subscription you purchase), and the credit card last used by you for an myeNovation transaction will automatically be charged at the start of each subscription period. All Fees are non-refundable—without limitation, we shall provide no refunds or credits for partial use of Service, for upgrades or downgrades, or for unused portions of subscriptions. For any subscription upgrade, the credit card last used by you for an myeNovation transaction will automatically be charged the new Fee on your next billing cycle. We reserve the right to change the Fees and to institute new charges and Fees at the end of each subscription period. Unpaid Fees are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection. You shall be responsible for all taxes, levies, or duties associated with the Services other than taxes based on myeNovation’s net income. All inquiries related to billing and credit card charges should be made in writing to ATTN:B1-1510, C, Blue Ridge - Paranjpe Schemes, Phase 1, Hinjewadi Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park, Hinjawadi, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Maharashtra 41105 India.

                            <strong>        7. CHANGES TO THE TERMS  </strong> <br/>
                            We may amend these Terms from time to time by posting an amended version in the Services and on our website. If you are a Free Account user, the amended version will become effective immediately as of the amended version’s Notice Date. If you are a new or returning user who registers for services on or after the Notice Date, the amended version will be effective immediately. If you are a current paying user of the Services, these Terms will continue under their original provisions for your original subscriptions, and the amended version will become effective at the start of your next myeNovation subscription period (including any new subscription or any automatically renewed subscription). Your use of the Services after an amended version becomes effective will confirm your acceptance and consent of that amended version. It is your responsibility to check the Services or our website (regularly, if a Free Account user, or prior to the start of your next myeNovation subscription period, if any other user) for amended versions of these Terms and to review any changes. These Terms may not be amended in any other way except through a written agreement executed by both you and an authorized representative of myeNovation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may amend our Privacy Policy or all other auxiliary policies at any time by posting amended versions on our website; the amended versions will become effective immediately upon posting.

                            <strong>        8. CHANGES TO SERVICES  </strong> <br/>
                            myeNovation is constantly innovating and evolving the Services in order to provide the best possible experience for our users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services may change from time to time without notice.

You agree that we shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of any part of the Services.

                            myeNovation expressly forbids all SPAM (the term "SPAM" meaning the sending of unsolicited e-mail to parties unknown to the sender). If you are found to be using the Services for SPAM, your account will be subject to immediate termination. The Services may only be used in connection with e-mail lists for which recipients have voluntarily registered. Using the Services to send e-mail to an address you obtain without the consent of the addressee is a violation these Terms. You are prohibited from importing e-mail addresses for persons who have not affirmatively and clearly elected to receive your mailings. For clarity, you will only send e-mail to persons who have willingly signed up to receive your mailings. If we receive complaints about your activities under this Section 9, your account may be subject to immediate termination. You will not send e-mail under any company or organization name other than your own company/organization, and you will not send e-mail with fraudulent or misleading header or source information. You are fully responsible for the contents of your messages and the consequences of any such messages. We shall have no responsibility or liability for messages or other content that is created by you. You shall not send, post, distribute or disseminate any defamatory, obscene, or otherwise unlawful messages, material, or information, including another person's proprietary information (including trademarks, trade secrets, or copyrighted information) without express authorization from the rights holder. myeNovation will cooperate with legal authorities in releasing names and IP addresses of users who are involved in SPAM or illegal activities.

                            You shall not use any “deep-link,” “page-scrape,” “robot,” “spider,” or other automatic device, program, algorithm, or methodology, or any similar or equivalent manual process (i) to access, acquire, copy, or monitor any portion of the Services or Our Content; (ii) to reproduce in any way or circumvent the navigational structure or presentation of the Services or Our Content; or (iii) to obtain or attempt to obtain any materials, documents, or information through any means not purposely made available through the Services.

You shall not take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the infrastructure of the Services or myeNovation’s systems or networks, or any systems or networks connected to the Services. In the event of such actions, we reserve the right to implement measures to ensure the quality and availability of the Services for all other myeNovation users. You shall not forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any message or transmittal you send to myeNovation or send while using the Services. You shall not, in connection with the Services, pretend (e.g. through impersonation) that you are any other individual or entity. You shall not remove any identifying language such as "Powered by myeNovation " or other similar message from the Services. Any modification of myeNovation's black top navigation bar, via Custom CSS or other means, is strictly prohibited.

Such changes include, but are not limited to, changing the Community name, changing the Community theme or focus, changing the language, changing the URL, or deleting a substantial portion of Community members in order to create a new Community. Any attempt to recycle a Community is a violation of these Terms of Service; myeNovation will determine such violations in its sole discretion.

                            The failure of either party to exercise or enforce any right contained in these Terms, is not a waiver of either parties’ right to do so later. myeNovation shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations in these Terms where such failure results from any cause beyond myeNovation’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation.
